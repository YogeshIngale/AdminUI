    <u>Welcome to India International Science Festival</u>
</h2>
<p>
    Science festivals are vibrant expression of the cultural importance of science and technology of a nation. It gives scientists,
    inventors and researchers a chance to interact closely with students and citizens from all walks of life. Science festivals offer many
    different forms of engagement such as, lectures, dialogues, panel discussions and debates; through handson demonstrations, shows,
    exhibitions, and workshops; in form of science-related theatre, cafes, music, and stand-up comedy. The goal of the science festivals is
    to engage citizens with science in ways that are inspirational and empowering. Science festivals are the inspiring celebrations of the
    fascinating world of science and technology.

    India International Science Festival (IISF) launched in 2015 is a celebration to promote Science and Technology and demonstrate how
    science could lead India towards a developed nation within a short span of time. The aim is to engage public with science and celebrate
    the joy of science and show the ways how science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) provide us with the solutions to
    improve our lives. Ministry of Science and Technology and Ministry of Earth Sciences in association with Vijnana Bharati (VIBHA), has
    created a unique platform of India International Science Festival which intends to inspire curiosity and make learning more rewarding.

<p>
    The goal of the Science festivity is to help youth, develop 21st century skills, with a focus on scientific knowledge, creativity,
    critical thinking, problem-solving, and teamwork. One longterm objective is to encourage students to study and work in scientific
    fields. The focus on the myriad faces behind some of the fascinating discoveries will inject scientific attitude in the masses and will
    give us the power to create new possibilities. Once we get young people interested in acquiring new knowledge, asking questions, and
    starting the quest for the answers, we will accomplish our goal. IISF is a science outreach marathon not a science sprint. We hope, this
    effort will fuel Indiaâ€™s drive toward becoming Vishwa Guru.
